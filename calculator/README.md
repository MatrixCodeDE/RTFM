# [RTFM](../README.md) - Calculator
A series of rather easy CTFs


## Calculator 1 - VERY EASY

An easy calculator with Python. It's hosted on our private server, but this shouldn't be a problem.\
Of course, it's [open source](./calculator_1/calculator.py).

## Calculator 2 - VERY EASY

We discovered, that our first version had some issues with the security and exploitability. This version should have fixed this.\
[Source code](./calculator_2/calculator.py)

## Calculator 3 - EASY

Due to further security risks, we expanded the blacklist. Now our calculator should be completely safe.\
[Source code](./calculator_3/calculator.py)

## Usage & Dependencies

The scripts are executed with Python. Tested with `Python >= 3.8`. No packages needed.

| Challenge    | Port |
